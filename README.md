This repository contains a Julia function with a bug. The function `my_function` is designed to return the square of its input if the input is positive, and the negative of the square if the input is negative. However, it fails to handle the case where the input is exactly 0, resulting in an error.  The solution file demonstrates how to resolve the bug by adding a return statement for the x == 0 case.
